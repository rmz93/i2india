				<p>I2india only takes on projects where it can add significant value in addition to investments. All entrepreneurs are subject to an intensive selection process. Selected entrepreneurs/teams are offered physical and managerial incubation support, in addition to financial investments. I2india takes an investment position in return for such support.</p>

				<p>Our typical investments are in the range of Rs 15-25 lakhs at the seed stage, with effort from our team that will be worth several times the financial capital. We also assist in syndicating the Series A round of funding, with other investors. In return, we typically take 12% equity in the incubatees in the seed stage, with an aim to increase our holding over subsequent rounds of funding. Since i2india wins only if the entrepreneur does, we follow a very stringent and Darwinian process for supporting promising companies. Entrepreneurs interested only in financial support are strongly encouraged NOT to apply.</p>

				<p>i2india, through its non-profit subsidiary, Technovate – runs a physical incubator in the heart of Bangalore. This center is equipped with all infrastructural and business services required to provide a plug-n-play environment for startups. Technovate’s unique business model has been officially recognized by the Government of India and is an approved Technology Business Incubator.</p>
